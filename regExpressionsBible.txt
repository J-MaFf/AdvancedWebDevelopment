RegEx Definitions:

    Literals, such as a, 1, or #, match the corresponding characters in the string.
   
    Character classes, such as [a-z], match any character within the specified range.

    Quantifiers, such as {3} and {2,4}, specify how many times the preceding pattern should be repeated.

    Groups, defined using ( and ), group together patterns and allow you to apply quantifiers and alternation to a group of patterns.
        (...)   - Capture group (assigns an array index)
        (?:...) - non Capturing group (does not assign array index) 


    Special characters, such as ., *, and +, have special meanings and are used to define more complex patterns.
        . - Matches any single character, except for a newline character
        ^ - Matches the beginning of a line or string
        $ - Matches the end of a line or string

        ? - Matches zero or one of the preceding character or expression

        \W - Matches any non-word character.
